## Hello
This is a placeholder for my profile page - I will publish here posts on Agile, Scrum, Kanban, IT Project Management, Product Ownership and ...

... how to have it "released" in real live.

### Who I am?
I am the IT Project Manager / Product Owner working with great team on Process Automation using MS SQL + MS VBA + QlikSense in Elekta Business Services.

I am also trying to "do something" in Power BI and recently we test Python.

### However, I think I am adding value by talking :) ...
- ... convincing people to test / reply / specify / calculate / decide / do x
- ... discussing Project Backlog priorities
- ... engaging people to projets
- ... motivating them
- ... escalating them
- ... facilitating workshops
- ... supporing Scurm ceremonies
- ... ect, ect
